# IML-ViT-Enhanced-Image-Manipulation-Localization-by-Vision-Transformer
This project enhances Vision Transformer (ViT) for image manipulation localization. Updates include single-GPU training, checkpoint handling, parameter freezing, and adjusted model saving/testing. A new classification branch, trained with BCEWithLogitsLoss, predicts image authenticity.
